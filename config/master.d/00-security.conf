#####        Security settings       #####
##########################################
# Enable "open mode", this mode still maintains encryption, but turns off
# authentication, this is only intended for highly secure environments or for
# the situation where your keys end up in a bad state. If you run in open mode
# you do so at your own risk!
#open_mode: False

# Enable auto_accept, this setting will automatically accept all incoming
# public keys from the minions. Note that this is insecure.
#auto_accept: False

# Time in minutes that an incoming public key with a matching name found in
# pki_dir/minion_autosign/keyid is automatically accepted. Expired autosign keys
# are removed when the master checks the minion_autosign directory.
# 0 equals no timeout
# autosign_timeout: 120

# If the autosign_file is specified, incoming keys specified in the
# autosign_file will be automatically accepted. This is insecure.  Regular
# expressions as well as globing lines are supported.
#autosign_file: /etc/salt/autosign.conf

# Works like autosign_file, but instead allows you to specify minion IDs for
# which keys will automatically be rejected. Will override both membership in
# the autosign_file and the auto_accept setting.
#autoreject_file: /etc/salt/autoreject.conf

# Enable permissive access to the salt keys. This allows you to run the
# master or minion as root, but have a non-root group be given access to
# your pki_dir. To make the access explicit, root must belong to the group
# you've given access to. This is potentially quite insecure. If an autosign_file
# is specified, enabling permissive_pki_access will allow group access to that
# specific file.
#permissive_pki_access: False

# Allow users on the master access to execute specific commands on minions.
# This setting should be treated with care since it opens up execution
# capabilities to non root users. By default this capability is completely
# disabled.
#publisher_acl:
#  larry:
#    - test.ping
#    - network.*
#
# Blacklist any of the following users or modules
#
# This example would blacklist all non sudo users, including root from
# running any commands. It would also blacklist any use of the "cmd"
# module. This is completely disabled by default.
#
#
# Check the list of configured users in client ACL against users on the
# system and throw errors if they do not exist.
#client_acl_verify: True
#
#publisher_acl_blacklist:
#  users:
#    - root
#    - '^(?!sudo_).*$'   #  all non sudo users
#  modules:
#    - cmd
#
# WARNING: client_acl and client_acl_blacklist options are deprecated and will
# be removed in the future releases. Use publisher_acl and
# publisher_acl_blacklist instead.

# Enforce publisher_acl & publisher_acl_blacklist when users have sudo
# access to the salt command.
#
#sudo_acl: False

# The external auth system uses the Salt auth modules to authenticate and
# validate users to access areas of the Salt system.
external_auth:
  pam:
    salt%:
      - '.*'       # unrestricted access to minion commands
      - '@wheel'   # to allow access to all wheel modules
      - '@runner'  # to allow access to all runner modules
      - '@jobs'    # to allow access to the jobs runner and/or wheel module

# Time (in seconds) for a newly generated token to live. Default: 12 hours
#token_expire: 43200

# Allow eauth users to specify the expiry time of the tokens they generate.
# A boolean applies to all users or a dictionary of whitelisted eauth backends
# and usernames may be given.
# token_expire_user_override:
#   pam:
#     - fred
#     - tom
#   ldap:
#     - gary
#
#token_expire_user_override: False

# Allow minions to push files to the master. This is disabled by default, for
# security purposes.
#file_recv: False

# Set a hard-limit on the size of the files that can be pushed to the master.
# It will be interpreted as megabytes. Default: 100
#file_recv_max_size: 100

# Signature verification on messages published from the master.
# This causes the master to cryptographically sign all messages published to its event
# bus, and minions then verify that signature before acting on the message.
#
# This is False by default.
#
# Note that to facilitate interoperability with masters and minions that are different
# versions, if sign_pub_messages is True but a message is received by a minion with
# no signature, it will still be accepted, and a warning message will be logged.
# Conversely, if sign_pub_messages is False, but a minion receives a signed
# message it will be accepted, the signature will not be checked, and a warning message
# will be logged. This behavior went away in Salt 2014.1.0 and these two situations
# will cause minion to throw an exception and drop the message.
# sign_pub_messages: False

# Use TLS/SSL encrypted connection between master and minion.
# Can be set to a dictionary containing keyword arguments corresponding to Python's
# 'ssl.wrap_socket' method.
# Default is None.
#ssl:
#    keyfile: <path_to_keyfile>
#    certfile: <path_to_certfile>
#    ssl_version: PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2
